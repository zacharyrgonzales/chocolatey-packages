    <description>## Introduction

New users to GitOps and Argo CD are not often sure how they should structure their repos, add applications, promote apps across environments, and manage the Argo CD installation itself using GitOps. 

Argo CD Autopilot saves operators time by:

- Installing and managing the Argo CD application using GitOps.
- Providing a clear structure for how applications are to be added and updated, all from git.
- Creating a simple pattern for making updates to applications and promoting those changes across environments.
- Enabling better disaster recovery by being able to bootstrap new clusters with all the applications previously installed.
- Handles secrets for Argo CD to prevent them from spilling into plaintext git. (Soon to come)

The Argo-CD Autopilot is a tool which offers an opinionated way of installing Argo-CD and managing GitOps repositories.

## Installation
### Using choco:
```powershell
# install
choco install argocd-autopilot
```

## Getting Started
```powershell
# All of the commands need your git token with the --git-token flag,
# or the GIT_TOKEN env variable:

    $GIT_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN

# The commands will also need your repo clone URL with the --repo flag,
# or the GIT_REPO env variable:

    $GIT_REPO=REPO_URL

# 1. Run the bootstrap installation on your current kubernetes context.
# This will install argo-cd as well as the application-set controller.

    argocd-autopilot repo bootstrap

# Please note that this will automatically attempt to create a private repository,
# if the clone URL references a non-existing one. If the repository already exists,
# the command will just clone it.

# 2. Create your first project

    argocd-autopilot project create my-project

# 3. Install your first application on your project

    argocd-autopilot app create demoapp --app github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot/examples/demo-app/ -p my-project
```

Now, if you go to your Argo-CD UI, you should see something similar to this:

Head over to our [Getting Started](./docs/Getting-Started.md) guide for further details.

## How it works
The autopilot bootstrap command will deploy an Argo-CD manifest to a target k8s cluster, and will commit an Argo-CD Application manifest under a specific directory in your GitOps repository. This Application will manage the Argo-CD installation itself - so after running this command, you will have an Argo-CD deployment that manages itself through GitOps.

From that point on, the user can create Projects and Applications that belong to them. Autopilot will commit the required manifests to the repository. Once committed, Argo-CD will do its magic and apply the Applications to the cluster.

An application can be added to a project from a public git repo + path, or from a directory in the local filesystem.
